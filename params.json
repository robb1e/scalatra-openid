My primary objective has been integrating with Google Apps so that I can back authentication against a domain which Google Apps provides services for.\r\n\r\nThis project uses SBT 0.10.1 and Scala 2.8.1\r\n\r\n## Running\r\n\r\nSBT is included here, so just run\r\n\r\n\t./sbt\r\n\t\r\nThen run the command\r\n\r\n\tjetty-run\r\n\r\n## openid4java\r\n\r\nPretty straight forward to include, although there is a dependency on Google Guice for which I had to add a new repository.\r\n\r\nTo include the Google Guice repository\r\n\r\n\t\"Guice Maven\" at \"http://guice-maven.googlecode.com/svn/trunk\"\r\n\r\nTo include the dependency\r\n\r\n\t\"org.openid4java\" % \"openid4java-consumer\" % \"0.9.6\"\r\n","name":"Scalatra-openid","tagline":"Hooking up Scalatra with OpenId"}
